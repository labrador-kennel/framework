Labrador is a microframework built on-top of [Amphp](https://github.com/amphp) and [Annotated Container](https://github.com/cspray/annotated-container). It offers a non-traditional way of writing small-to-medium sized applications in PHP. Among its many features includes:

- Everything in pure PHP. Have a fully-featured, web server up with `php app.php`
- Declarative approach to dependency injection
- Comprehensive, secure solution for handling configuration
- Asynchronous by default
- Robust, data-rich event system for knowing when things happen
- An easy-to-use HTTP and routing layer

If you're looking for a more complete skeleton to get started with writing Labrador-powered apps, you should check out [labrador-kennel/web-app](https://github.com/labrador-kennel/web-app); it is a skeleton for a complete app, including Docker setup and a database.
